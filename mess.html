<p>Considered as a D-list celebrity, Blac Chyna is best known as a stripper who dates famous rappers. In fact, Blac Chyna has a child by rapper Tyga. We know that Tyga has moved on to start dating famous reality star, Kylie Jenner.</p>

<h3>BOOM! That's right ladies and gentlemen, rapper Future</h3>
<br />
<br />
<p>Allegedly, For the past 3 months or so Blac Chyna and Future have been kicking it. Image wise, I don't know how this will play out for either individual given the fact that they both just recently excited public messy relationships with children included.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Apparently we all missed the pun intended within Future's lyrics that says "I blow a bag a day, Chyna gon' F%*!? me so crazy" in his latest song entitled 'Blow a bag'</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>Blac Chyna even went so far as to tattoo the rapper's name on er hand just after a few short weeks of dating.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Let's see what was future's response to this</p>

<p>OUCH! Blac Chyna it seems like Future only viewed you as a fling baby girl. Now that's a Hot Mess! Don't be a Chyna ladies. </p>
